At least, he did if you believe the story of 'The Dead Drummer Boy', and T J Northey's account of it:





> 


> On the 15th June, 1786, Jarvis (or Gervase) Matcham, a sailor, and a shipmate, named Sheppard, who had been paid off from the man-of-war Sampson, at Plymouth, were making their way homeward on foot. In the course of their journey they had to cross Salisbury Plain, and when they arrived near the Woodyates Inn, a thunderstorm, which appears to have been terrific in its character, overtook them. 


> 


> "It's a very sad thing to be caught in the rain, 


When night's coming on upon Salisbury Plain," 





The two men had some sort of vision. Charles G. Harper, writing in 1904, places the incident on the Blandford Road and says:





> Near the "Woodyates Inn" they were overtaken by a thunderstorm, when Matcham startled his messmate by showing extraordinary signs of horror and distracted faculties, running to and fro, falling on his knees, and imploring mercy of some invisible enemy. To his companion's questions he answered that he saw several strange and dismal spectres, particularly one in the shape of a woman, towards which he advanced, when it instantly sank into the earth and a large stone rose up in its place. Other large stones also rolled upon the ground before him, and came dashing against his feet. 


> 


> There can be no doubt that both Matcham and Shepherd were unnerved by the violence of the thunder and lightning, and that the terror of Matcham, who had very special reasons for fright, communicated itself to his friend to such a degree that when Matcham's diseased imagination saw moving shapes which had no existence, Shepherd readily saw them also. 


> 


> Thus, when the terrified Matcham fancied he saw numbers of stones with glaring eyes turn over and keep pace with them along the road, Shepherd very soon became afflicted with what specialists in mental phenomena term " collective hallucination." 


> 


> They then agreed to walk on either side of the road, and so perceive, by the behaviour of the stones, which of them it was who had so affronted God. The stones then exclusively accompanied Matcham all the way to the inn, where he beheld the Saviour and the drummer-boy, very terrible and accusing. To the roll of a drum, and in a terrific flash of lightning, they dissolved into dust. 


> 


Thereupon, overcome by these terrors, Matcham made confession there and then to Shepherd of a murder he had committed six years earlier, on the Great North Road, and begged his companion to hand him over to the nearest magistrate, in order that the avenging spectres and justice might be satisfied. He was accordingly committed at Salisbury pending inquiries as to the truth of his confession<a name="Source2" href="#Note2">[2]</a>. 








This was the basis for the poem '<em>The Dead Drummer Boy</em>' which is a good read. I've reproduced it in full below.

> 


> Oh, Salisbury Plain is bleak and bare, —


> At least so I’ve heard many people declare,


> For I fairly confess I never was there; —


> Not a shrub nor a tree,


> Nor a bush can you see:


> No hedges, no ditches, no gates, no stiles,


> Much less a house, or a cottage for miles; —


> — It’s a very sad thing to be caught in the rain


> When night’s coming on upon Salisbury Plain.


> 


> Now, I’d have you to know


> That a great while ago, —


> The best part of a century, may be, or so, —


> Across this same plain, so dull and so dreary,


> A couple of Travellers, way-worn and weary,


> Were making their way;


> Their profession, you’d say,


> At a single glance did not admit of a query;


> The pump-handled pig-tail, and whiskers worn then,


> With scarce an exception, by sea-faring men,


> The jacket, — the loose trousers ‘bows’d up together’ — all


> Guiltless of braces, as those of Charles Wetherall, —


> The pigeon-toed step, and the rollicking motion,


> Bespoke them two genuine sons of the Ocean,


> And show’d in a moment their real charácters,


> (The accent so placed on this word by our Jack Tars).


> 


> The one in advance was sturdy and strong,


> With arms uncommonly bony and long,


> And his Guernsey shirt


> Was all pitch and dirt,


> Which sailors don’t think inconvenient or wrong.


> He was very broad-breasted,


> And very deep-chested;


> His sinewy frame correspond with the rest did,


> Except as to height, for he could not be more


> At the most, you would say, than some five feet four.


> And, if measured, perhaps had been found a thought lower.


> Dame Nature, in fact, — whom some person or other,


> — A Poet, — has call’d a ‘capricious step-mother,’ —


> You saw when beside him,


> Had somehow denied him


> In longitude what she had granted in latitude.


> A trifling defect


> You’d the sooner detect


> From his having contracted a stoop in his attitude.


> Square-built and broad-shoulder’d, good-humour’d and gay,


> With his collar and countenance open as day,


> The latter — ’twas mark’d with small-pox, by the way, —


> Had a sort of expression good-will to bespeak;


> He’d a smile in his eye, and a quid in his cheek!


> And, in short, notwithstanding his failure in height,


> He was just such a man as you’d say, at first sight,


> You would much rather dine, or shake hands, with than fight!


> 


> The other, his friend and companion, was taller,


> By five or six inches, at least, than the smaller; —


> From his air and his mien


> It was plain to be seen,


> That he was, or had been,


> A something between


> The real ‘Jack Tar’ and the ‘Jolly Marine.’


> For, though he would give an occasional hitch,


> Sailor-like to his ‘slops,’ there was something, the which,


> On the whole savour’d more of the pipeclay than pitch. —


> Such were now the two men who appear’d on the hill,


> Harry Waters the tall one, the short ‘Spanking Bill.’


> To be caught in the rain,


> I repeat it again,


> Is extremely unpleasant on Salisbury Plain;


> And when with a good soaking shower there are blended


> Blue lightnings and thunder, the matter’s not mended;


> Such was the case


> In this wild dreary place,


> On the day that I’m speaking of now, when the brace


> Of trav’llers alluded to quicken’d their pace,


> Till a good steady walk became more like a race


> To get quit of the tempest which held them in chace.


> 


> Louder, and louder


> Than mortal gunpowder,


> The heav’nly artillery kept crashing and roaring,


> The lightning kept flashing, the rain too kept pouring,


> While they, helter-skelter,


> In vain sought for shelter


> From what I have heard term’d, ‘a regular pelter;’


> But the deuce of a screen


> Could be anywhere seen,


> Or an object except that on one of the rises,


> An old way-post show’d


> Where the Lavington road


> Branch’d off to the left from the one to Devizes;


> And thither the footsteps of Waters seem’d tending,


> Though a doubt might exist of the course he was bending,


> To a landsman, at least, who, wherever he goes,


> Is content, for the most part to follow his nose; —


> While Harry kept ‘backing


> And filling’ — and ‘tacking,’ —


> Two nautical terms which, I’ll wager a guinea, are


> Meant to imply


> What you, Reader, and I


> Would call going zig-zag, and not rectilinear.


> But here, once for all, let me beg you’ll excuse


> All mistakes I may make in the words sailors use —


> ‘Mongst themselves, on a cruise,


> Or ashore with the Jews,


> Or in making their court to their Polls and their Sues,


> Or addressing those slop-selling females afloat — women


> Known in our navy as oddly-named boat-women.


> The fact is, I can’t say,I’m versed in the school


> So ably conducted by Marryat and Poole;

> And get, the first time in their lives, in blue water;


> Of course in the use of sea terms you’ll not wonder


> If I now and then should fall into some blunder,

> How queer you do steer!’


> Cried Bill, whose short legs kept him still in the rear,


> ‘Why, what’s in the wind, Bo? — what is it you fear?’


> For he saw in a moment that something was frightening


> His shipmate much more than the thunder and lightning.


> 


> ‘Fear?’ stammer’d out Waters, ‘why, HIM! — don’t you see

> Wherever I go? —

> (With a brief explanation, that ended in ‘eyes,’)


> ‘What Drummer-boy, Waters? — the coast is all clear,

> Don’t let him come near!


> Only see how the blood-drops his features besmear!


> What, the dead come to life again! — Bless me! — Oh dear!’

> I can’t see no Drummer-boy here whatsumdever!’


> ‘Not see him! — why there; — look! — he’s close by the post —

> Where the gibbet — was — not —


> On which Matcham’s corse had been hung up to rot;


> It had fall’n down — but how long before, he’d forgot;


> And they told him, I think, at the Bear in Devizes,


> The town where the Sessions are held, — or the ‘Sizes,


> That Matcham confess’d,


> And made a clean breast


> To the May’r; but that after he’d had a night’s rest,


> And the storm had subsided, he ‘pooh-pooh’d’ his friend,


> Swearing all was a lie from beginning to end;


> Said ‘he’d only been drunk —


> hat his spirits had sunk


> At the thunder — the storm put him into a funk, —


> That, in fact, he had nothing at all on his conscience,


> And found out, in short, he’d been talking great nonsense.’ —


> 


> But now one Mr. Jones


> Comes forth and depones


> That fifteen years since, he had heard certain groans


> On his way to Stonehenge (to examine the stones


> Described in a work of the late Sir John Soane’s,)


> That he’d follow’d the moans, And, led by their tones,


> Found a Raven a-picking a Drummer-boy’s bones! —


> — Then the Colonel wrote word


> From the King’s Forty-third,


> That the story was certainly true which they’d heard,


> For, that one of their drummers, and one Sergeant Matcham,


> Had ‘brush’d with the dibs,’ and they never could catch ’em.


> So Justice was sure, though a long time she’d lagg’d,


> And the Sergeant, in spite of his ‘Gammon,’ got ‘scragg’d;’


> And people averr’d


> That an ugly black bird,


> The Raven, ’twas hinted, of whom we have heard,


> Though the story, I own, appears rather absurd,


> Was seen (Gervase Matcham not being interr’d),


> To roost all that night on the murderer’s gibbet;


> An odd thing, if so, and it may be a fib — it,


> However’s a thing Nature’s laws don’t prohibit.


> — Next morning they add, that ‘black gentleman’ flies out


> Having picked Matcham’s nose off, and gobbled his eyes out!


> Moral. -   Avis au Voyageur.


> Imprimis.


> If you contemplate walking o’er Salisbury plain,


> Consult Mr. Murphy, or Moore, and refrain


> From selecting a day when it’s likely to rain!


> 2nd.


> When trav’lling, don’t ‘flash’


> Your notes or your cash


> Before other people — it’s foolish and rash!


> 3rd.


> At dinner be cautious, and note well your party! —


> There’s little to dread where the appetite’s hearty, —


> But mind and look well to your purse and your throttle


> When you see a man shirking, and passing his bottle!


> 4th.


> If you chance to be needy,


> Your coat and hat seedy,


> In war time especially never go out


> When you’ve reason to think there’s a press-gang about!


> 5th.


> Don’t chatter, nor tell people all that you think,


> Nor blab secrets, — especially when you’re in drink. —


> But keep your own counsel in all that you do!


> — Or a Counsel may, some day or other, keep you.


> 6th.


> Discard superstition! — and don’t take a post,


> If you happen to see one at night, for a Ghost!


> — Last of all, if by choice or convenience you’re led


> To cut a man’s throat, or demolish his head,
